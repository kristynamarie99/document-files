W7 LOADER 0.94-DAZ
==================

0.94:
	* New SLIC table placement method using lower memory when
	  available, otherwise previous method is used.
	  Previous method available from recovery menu ("Older" option)

0.93:
	* Recovery menu now accessed by pressing ESC or R (Opa)
	* Changed "Windows 7" to "Windows" in menu (MyDigitalWife)
	  
0.92:
	* Typo fix in help text
	* Fixed changelog version mess

0.91:
	* Incorrect checksum issue in some cases (thanks tuvi123)
	* Several bug fixes relating to table relocation

0.90 / Beta 8d:
	* Moves out individual tables in the way of XSDT or RSDT expansion
	  if at all possible. If this fails, proceeds with usual relocaton.
	  This should help Mac compatibility. (thanks Barrym)

Beta 8c:
	* Re-added a couple of lines of code that got removed by mistake

Beta 8b:
	* Use alt mode when table clash occurs

Beta 8a:
	* Tiny correction to an error check

Beta 8:
	* Write-protected XSDT/RSDT tables are relocated (Dell, HP, etc.)
	  Simulated in VBox and on my PC this works, but not tested in
	  real world yet. May need tweaking.
	* Installs new tables and SLIC to lower memory if needed
	* New ACPI locating code; conforms to spec now (oops)
	* Removed some debug messages that could sometimes appear
	  during successful boot (still visible in --debug)
	* Still better SLIC placement (ongoing tweaks)
	* Couple of small errors fixed from beta 7
	* Added forced alternative loader mode (--alt) for testing.
	  Access this from the recovery menu.
	* Fixed rare checksum-correcting bug (another oops)

Beta 7:
	* Simplified debug output for easier debugging
	* All fatal errors wait for a key press before continuing, 
          so you can read the error! It helps... :)
	* Detects write-protected RSDT/XSDT (Dell, HP, etc.)
	  (currently no fix, just exits)
	* Better table extending code (+ fixed bugs)
	* Better SLIC placement in some cases

Beta 6:
	* Locates more ACPI tables accurately now (sleep fix?)
	* Fixed handling of table positions
	* More checks

Beta 5:
	* New feature: forceful mode. Tries to activate on systems where
	  some checks don't complete successfully. May cause problems.
	  Access this from the recovery menu.
	* More fine tuning

Beta 4:
	* Fixed bug: potentially not enough internal table storage
	* Internal change: OEM data correctly copied from SLIC (Daz)
	* Recovery menu bug fixes; also now red

Beta 3:
	* More verification and safety checks
	* Fix for Hazar's odd computer :) Thanks Hazar!
	* Full recovery menu included (see below))
	* Adjusted SLIC information for easier updates

Beta 2:
	* Alters the RSDT table in the same way as the XSDT table 
	* Many more pointer checks to reduce crash likelihood 
	* Optimised menu.lst

Beta:
	* Initial version
